# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2023-XXXXX) (UNRELEASED)

-  BREAKING: extractcode step is disabled, because it doesn't seem to work (why?).
-  BREAKING: License category is no longer stated by ScanCode, so we only work
   with specific license accepts now.

-  @todo Fix issue where "mit AND bsd" shows up even though both are accepted
   individually.

## 0.0.6 (2022-01-21)

-  Remove nonsensical print after running accept/unaccept commands.

## 0.0.5 (2021-12-09)

-  Don't run `audit` as part of a scan. This is a separate command and should
   be run separately.

## 0.0.4 (2021-12-08)

Initial release.
